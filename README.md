## Overview
 This exploratory data analysis (EDA) examines the factors influencing happiness scores, as measured by the United Nations (UN), across various countries. The analysis includes a comprehensive review of the data, visualization of key insights, and exploration of correlations between happiness scores and economic, health, freedom, family, and corruption indicators.

## Data Description
 The dataset used in this analysis contains happiness scores and corresponding indicators for various countries, as reported by the UN. The indicators include measures of economy, health, freedom, family, and corruption levels.

 ## Visualization
 - **Bar Charts for Happiness Scores**: Bar charts are utilized to showcase the distribution of happiness scores across countries. This visualization highlights the happiest and least happy countries based on their respective happiness scores, offering a quick snapshot of global happiness trends.
 -  **Boxplot for Comparing Each Region**: A box plot is created to compare happiness scores among different regions of the world. This visualization allows for the exploration of regional variations in happiness levels and provides insights into the distribution and variability of happiness scores across regions.
 - **Regression Plots & Correlation Matrix**: A correlation matrix is generated to visualize the relationships between happiness scores and the economic, health, freedom, family, and corruption indicators. Heatmap visualization techniques are applied to represent the strength and direction of correlations, providing a clear understanding of the interplay between happiness and socio-economic factors.

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that certain factors, such as economy, health, and freedom, exhibit stronger correlations with happiness scores compared to others. Notably, the [analysis on the 2015 data](./Happiness2015-EDA.ipynb) yielded more robust results due to the availability of fuller datasets.

This EDA serves as a foundation for further research into the determinants of happiness and underscores the importance of considering various socio-economic factors in understanding subjective well-being at a global scale.
